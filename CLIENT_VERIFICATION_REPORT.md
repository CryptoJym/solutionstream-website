#### Problem Statement (Direct Quote):
"In fact, one of Mōdere's biggest challenges came in 2013, back when they were known by a different name—Neways. While Neways offered products and services that were both safer and more effective than their competition, they weren't experiencing the growth they had planned for. The culprit? Their stagnating brand."

#### Specific Challenge Detail:
"In search of help, Mōdere reached out to SolutionStream, and as we always do, we started by carefully analyzing Mōdere's existing products and strategies. Almost immediately, our experts were able to identify several problems with their processes. Yes, their outdated UI and lack of social media tools were slowing their growth, but more importantly, they were missing a clear product strategy to guide their branding efforts."

#### Timeline and Delivery:
"In just three months, on time and under budget, the project was delivered, and Mōdere was thrilled."

#### International Scope:
"You see, Mōdere is an international company, and it still needed to push its vision across 13 international markets, each with its own unique requirements and difficulties. Not one to back down from a challenge, SolutionStream continued to deliver all projects within cost and time estimates."

They discovered that a large amount of their mobile site visitors were leaving the site before making a unit reservation. Many of these preferred to call the ESS call center to reserve a storage unit instead of reserving online. ESS wanted SolutionStream to refine, streamline, and innovate its mobile site to increase conversions while decreasing call center calls."

#### Company Scale:
"Extra Space Storage boasts nearly 1,500 stores in 39 states, with over 900,000 units and 103 million square feet of rentable space."

#### Specific Improvements:
"From our research, we found new UI elements and methods that the existing user path needed badly. The new designs integrated these into the user flow. We also identified some items and information that were superfluous to the experience. These were either deleted or moved to a more appropriate location on the site."

#### Can We Claim:
- "Redesigned mobile experience for 1,500+ location storage company"
- "Improved mobile unit reservation conversion flow"
- "Reduced call center dependency through enhanced mobile experience"

**MEASURABLE METRIC: 10X distributor growth (50,000 to 500,000 in 2 years)**

#### Problem Statement (Direct Quote):
"Facing this growth explosion, SeneGence came to SolutionStream looking for help. Their site was slow and made it difficult for distributors to manage their business and sell SeneGence products. On top of this, SeneGence was expanding into new markets, and they needed something that could satisfy users across the globe."

#### Critical Challenge:
"Just as we started closing in on a functional release, however, we were hit by an unexpected change. Due to SeneGence's incredible growth, they required that we build our system to handle significantly more concurrent users than we originally planned. To tackle this, we simulated users hitting the site using Azure's load-testing tools."

#### Specific Technical Solutions:
"We did interface tests using Jasmine and Karma, conducted rigorous quality assurance processes, and even ran a beta test with users. The end product was a hyper-focused dashboard that showed distributors the most relevant data first. We also cleaned up the navigation and modernized the design to make it more approachable."

#### Outcome Stated:
"Now, even if SeneGence decides to add another half million distributors, they have the tools and infrastructure to handle it."

4. **Theater management system**
5. **White-label service version** - for resale to Deluxe clients
6. **UX design and product vision** - aligned stakeholders post-merger

#### Problem Statement (Direct Quote):
"While Deluxe Technicolor had the budget, they lacked the resources and time to design a solution. And to make matters worse, they were coming off a recent company merger, meaning stakeholders from both sides had conflicting goals for the future."

#### Company Context:
"Founded in 1915, Deluxe Technicolor specializes in video distribution, meaning they help movie makers take their films from the camera to the big screen."

#### Approach & Methodology:
"With so many moving pieces to identify and manage, our first goal was to understand how the Deluxe Technicolor machine actually worked. We facilitated a SolutionMap with their team and ours, spending four days in a room working to clearly identify their problems before discussing a solution."

#### Specific Outcome:
"Our software solved their problems of digital encryption, key distribution, film scheduling, and theater management. Furthermore, we were able to include a white-label version to be sold as a service to Deluxe Technicolor clients who wanted their own branding. We are proud to have worked with the Deluxe Technicolor team to create the ultimate product to highlight their company vision. Not only is their data easier to access and manage, but it's all wrapped in a simple and beautiful customer experience."
