                  <p>Enterprise software has made giant leaps over the last decade and is now being adopted by businesses all over the world. But despite its rapid growth, <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/2420031/5-reasons-businesses-still-hate-enterprise-software.html">CIO reports that the majority of executives agree that they face significant challenges</a> when implementing or using their software. Here, we will talk about these challenges and what has been or can be done to address them.</p><h2><strong>Customization</strong></h2><p>One of the most common gripes among executives is customization, which poses a real problem for enterprise software developers. Business owners find themselves having to modify, at times unsuccessfully, the existing software to fit their specific needs. In this regard, <a href="https://online.maryville.edu/online-masters-degrees/software-development/">a Maryville University feature that focuses on software development graduates</a> highlights the importance of keeping track of interface design trends in the industry, as it is a key element of user experience. User-friendly interfaces, as well as the adoption of new low-code technology that allows users to drag and drop elements within their programs as they see fit, could well be the future for enterprise software. <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/why-wordpress-is-the-best-platform-to-build-your-business-or-startup-website-on-df3fe932fad7">A good example of low-code technology is WordPress</a>, which makes customization easy by allowing its users to drag and drop widgets, edit colors, manage content, and more without using complex code.</p><h2><strong>Off-site accessibility</strong></h2><p>Workforce trends are moving away from office environments and into homes and cafés as more and more companies embrace the remote working model. <a href="is-mobile-first-hype-in-2019.html">We have talked about the Mobile First hype here on Solution Stream</a> and how developers should be prioritizing this by thinking of mobile not in terms of smartphones or any other device, but as the <em>user</em>. Indeed, users have become and will continue to consume mobile content more regularly, especially when it comes to work. <a href="https://www.information-age.com/mobile-workforce-moving-forward-work-123468825/">A study published on Information Age</a> estimates that up to 1.87 billion people will become mobile workers in the next four years — that’s 42.5% of the total global workforce. Enterprise software developers need to adapt to this development by providing software that is accessible to employees wherever they are located in the world. On-site limitations that existing software have can be solved by applying mobile features such as offline modes, screen picture taking, barcode scanning, and the like.</p><h2><strong>Compatibility</strong></h2><p>Integration and implementation into systems is getting more difficult as software becomes ever more complex. This can cause a company’s programs to become disorganized and even damage productivity. Constant changes or upgrades also pose problems for developers during data migration, as the information coming from disjointed systems can be duplicated or even lost. Finding ways to make enterprise software compatible with existing programs is crucial for a much smoother user experience.</p><h2><strong>Relevance</strong></h2><p>Both IT infrastructures and business environments are constantly changing. Enterprise software developers face the challenge of meeting new demands at an incredibly fast pace. It’s a possibility that by the time software has been developed; the industry’s needs have already warped, making the software obsolete. One way to combat this is by releasing small but constant updates to meet a company&#039;s needs and by always being aware of the latest developments in both technology and business.</p><h2><strong>High cost</strong></h2><p>Hiring a team to install and integrate enterprise software into a company is not cheap, and executives who underestimate how much they have to shell out for these kinds of software may end up surprised with the price tag. Unfortunately, the cheques don’t end there, as regular upgrades and maintenance mean regular payment, as well. Being upfront with potential users about the pricing and opening up various payment schemes and options may be a solution to this. However, the best way to address this problem is simply to deliver quality software that makes the price a reasonable one in the end.<br><br>Current enterprise software technology has its flaws, but these are not impossible to solve, especially since software has become part and parcel of modern business operations. Investing in enterprise software and its upgrades is still better than doing everything in-house, where the risk of things going wrong is much higher. For now, identifying the challenges and discussing possible solutions will help both developers and business executives move forward and improve the technology.<br>Written by Alyssa Curtis.</p><p>Alyssa Curtis is a software developer and tech writer who spends most of her time keeping up-to-date with the latest trends in the field.
