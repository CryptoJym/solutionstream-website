                  <h2>Why You Should Get Rid of Your Outdated Software</h2><p>Software is constantly changing, evolving, and updating. If you find yourself dismissing those pesky reminders to download the latest version of everything you have on your computer, phone, or favorite operating system (OS) then you will soon find yourself with outdated software. </p><p>Imagine you’ve made some cookies only to learn when you bite into them that the recipe is bad.</p><p>With outdated software, you might have a similar experience. You aren’t sure where the problem is, but you know the result is problematic for your users. It is hard to access information, difficult to achieve appropriate results, or the program takes too much time away from your technical team. </p><p>Companies hold onto old systems for a variety of reasons, including cost and priorities. Whatever your reason, it’s time to let go. Here’s why you should throw your old, outdated software in the trash. </p><h3>Outdated Software is Dangerous</h3><p>To keep your software healthy, you must reduce risk by finding and eliminating any weak links or holes. The weakest link is often an outdated OS.  </p><p>Your old OS is letting in hackers and thieves. As malware and viruses become more and more sophisticated, old systems grow weaker and easy to break into. This is especially dangerous if you maintain a system that involves client information. </p><p>Employee information, company documents/records, and client portals are all at risk of being accessed, stolen, and lost. </p><p>This isn’t only a risk for large companies with hundreds of employees; small to midsize businesses (SMBs) also find that their systems are vulnerable to hackers. What was once considered unnecessary becomes essential when you are responsible for important information that may be at risk.</p><p>The security risks should always outweigh any cost of updating your software.</p><h3>Outdated Software is Costly</h3><p>Old software costs twice as much as healthy, updated software. This isn’t because of initial costs, but because of time and personnel.</p><p>With your outdated software comes a string of errors, each representing tasks that take time away from the core objectives of your company. Instead, that time is invested in putting out fires. Unfortunately, when dealing with old software, these small “fires” are actually being fed by a huge fire that just won’t go out no matter how many little problems you solve along the way. </p><p>Sooner or later, the building will burn down, and when it does, the cleanup and reconstruction will cost exponentially more than what it would have cost to apply any updates.</p><p>When it comes to personnel, old software often requires specific coding languages or processes that your current employees might not possess. Your outdated system will require maintenance, and with that maintenance comes a team of developers who are familiar with it.</p><h3>Outdated Software is Inefficient</h3><p>Outdated software takes valuable time out of your business and makes your system inefficient. </p><p>Using outdated software for user-centered applications not only hurts the user, but also the future of your business. When a program experiences frequent crashes because of age, it makes it more difficult to access and thus prevents clients from experiencing what your company has to offer.</p><p>Your old systems lack flexibility, which is important to remaining up to date within your industry. As part of a business-centric economy, each company is always looking for the next thing that will place them above the competition. </p><p>Don’t wait until the old system breaks; instead, save time and effort by keeping track of regular updates or by improving your software in a significant way so it performs the way you need it to. </p><p>Don’t let your outdated software hold you back. </p><h3>Outdated Software is Not the Solution</h3><p>Efficient and successful businesses value every part of their process. This includes the functions of core software. Whether that software was initially developed and built by your teams or purchased through a SaaS vendor, it can quickly become outdated if you aren’t careful.</p><p>Ignoring updates and hoping for the best is not the answer. Waiting until the ideal time to change your software is not the answer.</p><p>Find solutions at SolutionStream to customize, build, or update your software.</p><p><br></p>
